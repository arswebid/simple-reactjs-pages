# how to create a navigation system in ReactJS to connect pages. 

First, create a new React component for each page you want to display. For example, if you want to create a "Home" page and a "About" page

Create a new component to act as the main navigation menu. You can use the Link component from the react-router-dom package to create clickable links that will change the URL and render the corresponding page.

Create a new component to act as the main layout for your website. This component should render the navigation menu and use the Switch and Route components from react-router-dom to map the URLs to the corresponding page components.

Finally, wrap your App component with a BrowserRouter component from react-router-dom to enable client-side routing.

With these components, you should be able to create a basic navigation system in ReactJS that can display multiple pages. The Link component will handle the URL changes and the Switch and Route components will render the correct page based on the URL.
